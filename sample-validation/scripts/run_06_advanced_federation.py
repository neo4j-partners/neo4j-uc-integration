"""Advanced federated queries: Neo4j UC JDBC aggregates + Delta sensor telemetry.

Combines live Neo4j graph aggregates (via remote_query) with Delta lakehouse
sensor readings for richer operational analytics. Uses the materialized Delta
tables from run_04 (neo4j_aircraft, neo4j_systems, neo4j_sensors, etc.) for
proper sensor→system→aircraft joins rather than REGEXP_EXTRACT approximations.

Prerequisites:
  - run_01_connect_test.py (UC JDBC connection + sensor_readings table)
  - run_04_materialized_tables.py (neo4j_aircraft, neo4j_systems, neo4j_sensors,
    neo4j_maintenance_events Delta tables)

Sections:
  1. Per-aircraft maintenance + sensor health
     Neo4j: maintenance counts by aircraft via remote_query
     Delta:  EGT and Vibration averages/max via sensor→system→aircraft join

Usage (via runner):
    uv run python -m cli upload run_06_advanced_federation.py
    uv run python -m cli submit run_06_advanced_federation.py
