"""Materialize Neo4j graph data as Delta tables and run SQL validation queries.

Reads all node types from Neo4j via the Python driver and writes them as
Delta tables in the Unity Catalog schema. Also materializes aircraft-system
relationships via UC JDBC NATURAL JOIN. Then runs SQL validation tests and
federated queries that join the materialized graph tables with the Delta
sensor_readings table loaded by run_02.

Sections:
  1. Verify data sources (Delta sensor_readings, Neo4j node counts via JDBC)
  2. Materialize Neo4j nodes and relationships as Delta tables
  3. SQL validation tests
  4. Federated queries on materialized graph + sensor readings

Prerequisites:
  - run_01_connect_test.py must have run (creates UC JDBC connection)
  - run_02_federated_queries.py must have run (loads Neo4j graph and sensor_readings)

Usage (via runner):
    uv run python -m cli upload run_03_materialized_tables.py
    uv run python -m cli submit run_03_materialized_tables.py
