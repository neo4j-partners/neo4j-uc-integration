"""Run federated queries joining Delta sensor data with Neo4j graph data via UC JDBC.

Each query combines:
  - Delta: sensor_readings table (time-series sensor telemetry)
  - Neo4j: graph topology and operational data via UC JDBC

Prerequisites:
  - run_00_load_graph.py must have run (loads Neo4j graph)
  - run_01_connect_test.py must have run (creates UC JDBC connection and sensor_readings table)

Queries:
  1. Sensor health by aircraft — Neo4j topology (Python driver) + Delta sensor stats
  2. Maintenance severity and sensor health — Neo4j JDBC aggregates + Delta sensor averages
  3. Flight delay analysis by operator — Neo4j JDBC aggregates

Usage (via runner):
    uv run python -m cli upload run_02_federated_queries.py
    uv run python -m cli submit run_02_federated_queries.py
