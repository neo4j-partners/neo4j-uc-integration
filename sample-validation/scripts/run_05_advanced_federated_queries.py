"""Validate advanced SQL-to-Cypher translation and federated queries.

Tests the SQL-to-Cypher translator systematically across GROUP BY, HAVING,
ORDER BY, LIMIT, OFFSET, DISTINCT, and combinations. Closes with two federated
queries that embed these results inside Spark SQL joins against Delta sensor data.

Prerequisites:
  - run_00_load_graph.py must have run (loads Neo4j graph data)
  - run_01_connect_test.py must have run (creates UC JDBC connection and sensor_readings table)

Sections:
  1. GROUP BY — projected key, non-projected key, multiple aggregates
  2. HAVING — simple, compound, non-projected aggregate
  3. ORDER BY — on aggregate alias, multi-key
  4. DISTINCT + GROUP BY
  5. LIMIT + OFFSET
  6. All clauses combined
  7. Federated: Neo4j GROUP BY result joined with Delta sensor data
  8. Federated: Neo4j HAVING filter joined with Delta engine performance data
  9. JOIN + GROUP BY — non-projected and projected group key
  10. HAVING without GROUP BY
  11. WHERE + GROUP BY — filtered aggregations
  12. Additional aggregate functions — stDev, stDevP
  13. HAVING + ORDER BY + LIMIT + OFFSET combined

Usage (via runner):
    uv run python -m cli upload run_05_advanced_federated_queries.py
    uv run python -m cli submit run_05_advanced_federated_queries.py
