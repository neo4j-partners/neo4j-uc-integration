:description: Verify Delta lakehouse tables and Neo4j UC JDBC connection before running federated queries

Confirm both the Delta lakehouse tables and the Neo4j UC JDBC connection are accessible before running federated queries.

**Federation Method:** `remote_query()` (UC JDBC) + Delta SQL

== Data Flow

[listing]
....
Spark SQL ──► Delta Lakehouse ──► SELECT COUNT(*) FROM each table
    │
    └──────► Neo4j (UC JDBC) ──► remote_query() ──► SELECT COUNT(*) per node label
....

== Verify Delta Lakehouse Tables

Count rows in each Delta table to confirm they are populated:

[source,python]
----
for table in ["aircraft", "systems", "sensors", "sensor_readings"]:
    count = spark.sql(f"SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM {table}").collect()[0]["cnt"]
    print(f"  {table}: {count:,} rows")
----

Sample aircraft query:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT `:ID(Aircraft)` AS aircraft_id, tail_number, model, manufacturer, operator
FROM aircraft LIMIT 5
----

.Expected Output
[cols="1,1,1,1,1"]
|===
|aircraft_id |tail_number |model |manufacturer |operator

|AC-001
|N7001X
|737-800
|Boeing
|United Airlines

|AC-002
|N7002X
|A320neo
|Airbus
|Delta Air Lines
|===

== Verify Neo4j UC JDBC Connection

Use `remote_query()` to count nodes by label:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT * FROM remote_query('neo4j_uc_connection',
    query => 'SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM MaintenanceEvent')

SELECT * FROM remote_query('neo4j_uc_connection',
    query => 'SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM Flight')
----

Test a graph traversal (Flight→Airport relationships):

[source,sql]
----
SELECT * FROM remote_query('neo4j_uc_connection',
    query => 'SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt
              FROM Flight f
              NATURAL JOIN DEPARTS_FROM r
              NATURAL JOIN Airport a')
----

== What This Verifies

* Delta tables are accessible in the current catalog/schema context
* The Neo4j UC JDBC connection (`remote_query()`) can execute SQL queries against Neo4j
* Neo4j's SQL2Cypher translation handles `NATURAL JOIN` for relationship traversals
* Both data sources are ready for federated queries in subsequent examples
