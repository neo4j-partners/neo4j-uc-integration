= Query 2: Fleet Summary
:description: Fleet-wide overview combining Neo4j graph metrics with Delta sensor analytics via remote_query()

Fleet-wide overview combining Neo4j graph metrics with Delta sensor analytics in a single SQL statement. No Spark Connector needed, using pure SQL federation via UC JDBC.

**Federation Method:** `remote_query()` (UC JDBC) with CROSS JOINs

== What This Query Does

* **Neo4j side** (4 `remote_query()` calls): Counts maintenance events (total + critical), flights, and flight→airport graph traversals
* **Delta side** (1 subquery): Computes fleet-wide sensor averages across all 345K+ readings by sensor type
* **CROSS JOIN**: Combines the single-row results from both sides into one unified fleet summary

== Actual Output (Databricks Runtime 17.3 LTS)

The following output was captured from a live Databricks cluster running against Neo4j Aura and Delta lakehouse tables:

== Key Pattern

`remote_query()` returns a single-row table per call, making CROSS JOINs natural for combining multiple aggregate metrics. This avoids the GROUP BY limitation of UC JDBC while keeping the query entirely in SQL.
